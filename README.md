# Olympic Hide & Seek Retrospective: Atlanta 1996

This is my entry for the 2020 Js13kGames competition.

## Instructions

Install npm dependencies via `npm install`

You can either run the tasks individually or just run `gulp` which will `build -> zip -> serve -> watch`. After the watch is triggered, any changes will trigger this process to run again.

Description on the project structure and some notes on the gulp build script are available in this [post](http://thecodeship.com/web-development/bootstrap-vanilla-js-game-gulp-build-project-setup/).

Once the game has been built, go to http://localhost:5000 to play it.
